On OSX or Ubuntu
================

to install the module and the scripts:
  sudo python setup.py install --record installed-files.txt

setup.py uses setuptools, so if not already installed you can install with
  sudo apt-get install python-setuptools

to uninstall the module (you need a recent version of pip):
  sudo pip uninstall pysilfont

to get rid of all the files installed : (careful with rm)
  cat installed-files.txt | xargs sudo rm --verbose -vr

For OSX users, see also scripts/tools/actionsosx/README.txt
